</div>


## Before learning to code...

I worked in several tech and e-commerce companies, managing projects and growing revenues.

I first discovered the buzzing world of a game development company ðŸŽ® working at [Ubisoft](https://www.ubisoft.com/)

Then at ðŸšŒ [Camboticket](https://www.camboticket.com/), I had various missions to increase sales volume.

Finally as general manager of [Delishop](https://delishop.asia/), an e-commerce start-up ðŸ›’ of more than 30 employees, I oversaw the release of the new website and app.


## Currently...

Looking for my first experience working as a fullstack web developer! ðŸ’ª
